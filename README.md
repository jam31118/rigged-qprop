# Visualization
For visualizing the calculation result by `rigged-qprop`, have a look at [visual-qprop](https://github.com/jam31118/qprop), a toolset dedicated to visualize and analyze the calculation results such as animated time evolution, plotting photoelectric momentum spectra etc.


# PPP : Paralleled Post Propagation
Implemented for parallel computing, PPP routine boosts the post propagation, which is often essential for evaluating low-energy structure in momentum spectra through t-SURFF routine.

After compilation along with this PPP support, check out the example using this routine, for example:
``` bash
cd $QPROP_HOME/src/example/ppp/attoclock-ppp
bash ../run.sh
```
Noting that, for the `attoclock` example, more than 90% of the timesteps for propagation is the field-free post-propagation, it can benefit from `PPP` quite a lot.
