# Prerequisites
## Environment Variable
`export QPROP_HOME=/path/to/home/directory/of/cloned/repository`

`export QPROP_DEP_HOME=/path/in/which/dependencies/are/intalled`

The directory tree pointed by `$QPROP_DEP_HOME` should be like the following:

```bash
$QPROP_DEP_HOME/
  boost_1_65_1/
  gsl-2.4/
  openmpi-1.10.7/
```

where subdirectories are intallation directory of each dependency.

For example, the directory tree of `gsl-2.4/` for GSL library, should be:

```bash
$QPROP_DEP_HOME/
  gsl-2.4/
    bin/
    include/
    lib/
    share/
```
